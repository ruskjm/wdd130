                <h3 class="strength">Strength Training</h3>
                <p>Strength training (also known as resistance training) is a type of exercise that causes your muscles to contract against an outside resistance.<p>
                <p>The outside resistance can be from your body weight, weight machines, medicine balls, resistance bands or dumbbells.<p>
                <p>Try to dedicate 30 to 60 minutes a day, two days a week. Select four to six exercises that target different major muscle groups.</p>

            <section class="paragraph3">
                <h3 class="flexibility">Flexibility Training</h3>
                <p>Flexibility exercises are activities that improve the ability of a joint to maintain the movement necessary for carrying out daily tasks and physical activity. Examples of flexibility activities include: stretching. yoga. tai chi.<p>
                <p>The best time to do flexibility exercises is when your muscles are already warm so they can stretch farther without tightness or pain.<p>
                <p>You can achieve the most benefits by stretching regularly, at least two to three times a week. Even 5 to 10 minutes of stretching at a time can be helpful. Skipping regular stretching means that you risk losing the potential benefits.</p>    
                <p>"Flexibility is the key to stability." - John Wooden<p>
