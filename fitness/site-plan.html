      <p>
        Before you start a journey, you need to first know where you are going and how to get there. This website will start you on your fitness journey. The first step is to know your body composition. After you know more about your body you can create fitness plans that best fits you.  Start small than build upon it.
      </p>
      <p>
        I started on my fitness journey earlier this year and have seen huge improvements in my health. This purpose of the website is to share what I have learned and applied on my journey. It was not an easy journey but well worth it in the end.   </p>
      <p>
        Be patient as you start your journey. You might not be able to lift a lot of weights or even touch your toes. There will be challenges along the way. If you stick with a plan, you will see results. Also remember that you are human and not every day will be easy on the journey. Give yourself some grace and it's okay to have an off day.

      <h3>Nutrition</h3>
      <p>
        Another important aspect of fitness is nutrition.  This page will show you proper nutrition for your entire body.  Nutrition is an aspect of fitness that people sometimes forget.      </p>

        <h3>Exercise</h3>
      <p>
        The next step is to start to increase your exercise.  This page will introduce you to some basic exercises to increase your heart rate and ultimately your energy.  In the beginning it will be tough but if you stick with it you will start to see big improvements in your energy levels.  Don't expect to run a marathon on the first day (or ever if you don't want to).  Start out slow with something like walking or biking.  Then build up to harder endurance activities.       </p>
