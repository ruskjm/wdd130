    <h2>Jason Rusk</h2>
    <p>My name is Jason Rusk. I live in Sacramento, California with my wife of 26 years. We have 4 children with only the youngest (14) living at home.  Getting close to being empty nesters.  I have two daughters who attend BYU Idaho in person and my wife is also a BYU Idaho online student.</p>
    <p>I joined the church when I was a senior in high school. It has been a blessing to me and my family.</p>
    <p>I am currently a Developer for a hospital in Northern California where I have worked for over 20 years. I decided to go back to school to gain new skills in the IT field. I look forward to learning web development as it is something I have little experience in.</p>
    <p>My wife and I love to go on adventures. The picture of us is a 14-mile hike with did along the Pacific Ocean over the summer.  blah blah vlaklksad</p>
